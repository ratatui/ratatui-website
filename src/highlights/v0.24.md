# [v0.24.0](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/releases/tag/v0.24.0)

⚠️ We created a [breaking changes](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/blob/main/BREAKING-CHANGES.md) document for easily going through the breaking changes in each version.

## Ratatui Website/Book 📚

The site you are browsing right now (`ratatui.rs`) is the new homepage of `ratatui`!
For now, we host the book here which contains a bunch of useful tutorials, concepts and FAQ sections and there
is a [plan](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui-book/issues/115) to create a landing page [pretty soon](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui-book/pull/116)!

All the code is available at <https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui-book>

## Frame: no more generics 🚫

If you were using the `Frame` type with a `Backend` parameter before:

```rust
fn draw<B: Backend>(frame: &mut Frame<B>) {
    // ...
}
```

You no longer need to provide a generic over backend (`B`):

```rust
fn draw(frame: &mut Frame) {
    // ...
}
```

## New Demo / Examples ✨

We have a new kick-ass demo!

![demo2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/aa09e59dc0058347f68d7c1e0c91f863c6f2b8c9/examples/demo2.gif)

To try it out:

```sh
cargo run --example demo2
```

> The code is available [here](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/tree/main/examples/demo2).

We also have a new example demonstrating how to create a custom widget.

![custom widget](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/images/examples/custom_widget.gif)

```sh
cargo run --example=custom_widget --features=crossterm
```

> The code is available [here](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/blob/main/examples/custom_widget.rs).

Lastly, we added an example to demonstrate RGB color options:

![RGB colors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/images/examples/colors_rgb.png)

```sh
cargo run --example=colors_rgb --features=crossterm
```

> The code is available [here](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/blob/main/examples/colors_rgb.rs).

## Window Size API 🪟

A new method called `window_size` is added for retrieving the window size.
It returns a struct called `WindowSize` that contains both pixels (width, height) and columns/rows
information.

```rust
let stdout = std::io::stdout();
let mut backend = CrosstermBackend::new(stdout);
println!("{:#?}", backend.window_size()?;
```

Outputs:

```
WindowSize {
    columns_rows: Size {
        width: 240,
        height: 30,
    },
    pixels: Size {
        width: 0,
        height: 0,
    },
}
```

With this new API, the goal is to improve image handling in terminal emulators
by sharing terminal size and layout information,
enabling precise image placement and resizing within rectangles.

## BarChart: Render _smol_ charts 📊

We had a bug where the `BarChart` widget doesn't render labels that are full width.
Now this is fixed and we are able to render charts smaller than 3 lines!

For example, here is how `BarChart` is rendered and resized from a single line to 4 lines in order:

```
  ▁ ▂ ▃ ▄ ▅ ▆ ▇ 8


  ▁ ▂ ▃ ▄ ▅ ▆ ▇ 8
a b c d e f g h i

  ▁ ▂ ▃ ▄ ▅ ▆ ▇ 8
a b c d e f g h i
      Group

          ▂ ▄ ▆ █
  ▂ ▄ ▆ 4 5 6 7 8
a b c d e f g h i
      Group
```

If you set `bar_width(2)` then it is rendered as:

```
          ▂ ▄ ▆ █
  ▂ ▄ ▆ 4 5 6 7 8
a b c d e f g h i
      Group
```

## Block: custom symbols for borders 🛡️

The `Block` widget has a new method called `border_set` that can be used to specify the symbols that are
going to be used for the borders.

```rust
Block::default()
    .borders(Borders::ALL)
    .border_set(border::Set {
        top_left: "1",
        top_right: "2",
        bottom_left: "3",
        bottom_right: "4",
        vertical_left: "L",
        vertical_right: "R",
        horizontal_top: "T",
        horizontal_bottom: "B",
    })
```

When rendered:

```
1TTTTTTTTTTTTT2
L             R
3BBBBBBBBBBBBB4
```

There are also 2 new border types added (`QuadrantInside`, `QuadrantOutside`).

See the available border types at <https://docs.rs/ratatui/latest/ratatui/widgets/block/enum.BorderType.html>

Also, there are breaking changes to note here:

-   `BorderType::to_line_set` is renamed to `to_border_set`
-   `BorderType::line_symbols` is renamed to `border_symbols`

## Canvas: half block marker 🖼️

A new marker named `HalfBlock` is added to `Canvas` widget along with the associated
`HalfBlockGrid`.

The idea is to use half blocks to draw a grid
of "pixels" on the screen. Because we can set two colors per cell, and
because terminal cells are about twice as tall as they are wide, we can
draw a grid of half blocks that looks like a grid of square pixels.

```rust
Canvas::default()
    .marker(Marker::HalfBlock)
    .x_bounds([0.0, 10.0])
    .y_bounds([0.0, 10.0])
    .paint(|context| {
        context.draw(&Rectangle {
            x: 0.0,
            y: 0.0,
            width: 10.0,
            height: 10.0,
            color: Color::Red,
        });
    });
```

Rendered as:

```
█▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀█
█        █
█        █
█        █
█        █
█        █
█        █
█        █
█        █
█▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄█
```

## Line: raw constructor 📝

You can simply construct `Line` widgets from strings using `raw` (similar to `Span::raw` and
`Text::raw`):

```rust
let line = Line::raw("test content");
```

One thing to note here is that multi-line content is converted to multiple spans with the new lines removed.

## Rect: is empty? 🛍️

With the newly added `is_empty` method, you can check if a `Rect` has any area or not:

```rust
assert!(!Rect::new(1, 2, 3, 4).is_empty());
assert!(Rect::new(1, 2, 0, 4).is_empty());
assert!(Rect::new(1, 2, 3, 0).is_empty());
```

## Layout: LRU cache 📚

The layout cache now uses a [`LruCache`](https://docs.rs/lru/latest/lru/struct.LruCache.html) with default size set to 16 entries.
Previously the cache was backed by a `HashMap`, and was able to grow
without bounds as a new entry was added for every new combination of
layout parameters.

We also added a new method called `init_cache` for changing the cache size if necessary:

```rust
Layout::init_cache(10);
```

This will only have an effect if it is called prior to any calls to `layout::split()`.

## Backend: optional underline colors 🎨

Windows 7 doesn't support the underline color attribute, so we need to make it optional. For that,
we added a feature fla called `underline-color` and enabled it as default.

It can be disabled as follows for applications that supports Windows 7:

```toml
ratatui = { version = "0.24.0", default-features = false, features = ["crossterm"] }
```

## Stylized strings ✨

Although the [`Stylize`](https://docs.rs/ratatui/latest/ratatui/style/trait.Stylize.html) trait is already implemented for `&str` which
extends to `String`, it is not implemented for `String` itself.

So we added an implementation of `Stylize` for `String` that returns `Span<'static>` which makes the
following code compile just fine instead of failing with a temporary value error:

```rust
let s = format!("hello {name}!", "world").red();
```

This may break some code that expects to call `Stylize`
methods on `String` values and then use the String value later.
For example, following code will now fail to compile because the `String` is consumed by `set_style`
instead of a slice being created and consumed.

```rust
let s = String::from("hello world");
let line = Line::from(vec![s.red(), s.green()]); // fails to compile
```

Simply clone the `String` to fix the compilation error:

```rust
let s = String::from("hello world");
let line = Line::from(vec![s.clone().red(), s.green()]);
```

## Spans: RIP 💀

The `Spans` was deprecated and replaced with a more ergonomic `Line` type in 0.21.0 and now it is
removed.

Long live `Line`!
