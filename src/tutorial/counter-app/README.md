# Counter App

In the previous section, we built a "hello world" TUI. In this tutorial, we'll
develop a simple counter application.

For the app, we'll need a `Paragraph` to display the counter. We'll also want to
increment or decrement the counter when a key is pressed. Let's increment and
decrement the counter with `j` and `k`.
