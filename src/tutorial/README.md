# Tutorial

## [Counter App](./counter-app/README.md)

This tutorial will set up the basics of a `ratatui` project by building a app
that displays a counter.

## [JSON Editor](./json-editor/README.md)

This tutorial will guide you through setting up a Rust project and organizing
its structure for a `ratatui`-based application to edit json key value pairs.
JSON Editor TUI will provide an interface for users to input key-value pairs,
which are then converted into correct JSON format and printed to stdout.
