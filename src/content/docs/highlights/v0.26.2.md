## MSRV: 1.74.0 🦀

The minimum supported Rust version of Ratatui is updated from `1.70.0` to `1.74.0`.

## List: Scroll Padding 📜

We introduced a new method for `List` which allows a certain number of items be kept visible above
and below the currently selected item while scrolling.

```rust
let list = List::new(items).scroll_padding(1);
```

<summary>Demo of the new behavior</summary>

## Text: Construct from Iterator 🏗️

`Line` and `Text` widgets now implement `FromIterator` which means you can:

- Construct `Line` from an iterator of `Span`

```rust
let line = Line::from_iter(vec!["Hello".blue(), " world!".green()]);
let line: Line = iter::once("Hello".blue())
    .chain(iter::once(" world!".green()))
    .collect();
```

- Construct `Text` from an iterator of `Line`

```rust
let text = Text::from_iter(vec!["The first line", "The second line"]);
let text: Text = iter::once("The first line")
    .chain(iter::once("The second line"))
    .collect();
```

---

## Text: Push Methods 📥

We added the following methods to the `Text` and `Line` structs:

- `Text::push_line`
- `Text::push_span`
- `Line::push_span`

This allows for adding lines and spans to a text object without having to call methods on the fields
directly, which is usefult for incremental construction of text objects.

For example:

```rust
let mut line = Line::from("Hello, ");
line.push_span(Span::raw("world!"));
line.push_span(" How are you?");
```

---

## Implement Widget for strings 🧶

`Widget` is now implemented for `&str` and `String`, which makes it easier to render strings with no
styles as widgets.

Example usage:

```rust
terminal.draw(|f| f.render_widget("Hello World!", f.size()))?;
```

---

## Span: Rename Methods 🔄

The following Span methods are renamed accordingly to the Rust method naming conventions.

Deprecated usage:

- `Span::to_centered_line`
- `Span::to_left_aligned_line`
- `Span::to_right_aligned_line`

New usage:

- `Span::into_centered_line`
- `Span::into_left_aligned_line`
- `Span::into_right_aligned_line`
