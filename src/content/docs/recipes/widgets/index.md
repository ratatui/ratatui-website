Widgets are types that implement the [`Widget`] or [`StatefulWidget`] trait which allows
applications to render them to a terminal.

The following pages document how to use the following widgets:

- [Block](./block/)
- [Paragraph](./paragraph/)
- [Custom Widgets](./custom/)

There are more widgets available than just the above list. The crate docs document all the built-in
widgets. See the [`widgets` module] for a list. There are also [Third Party Crates] that implement
more widgets.
